Summary of events since 17th:

Braylen asked to be relieved of involvement with SRE/Kubernetes topics and passed scrum leadership to Jeremy, so we redistributed the workload last friday. Braylen solo implemented JWT authorization, and in parallel Aaron implemented cookie based authentication. We chose to go with JWT. Jeremy wrote a temp init.sql, wrote the manifests, and set up the build pipeline using a Jenkinsfile. Jeremy and Aaron troubleshooted kubernetes & prometheus discovery issues and ultimately resolved them. 

Braylen:

	Worked:
		Implemented and refactored project from sessions, in a branch, to JWT based authentication. Noted a bug in login.
		Also wrote a new init.sql
		
	Goal:
		JUnit
		
	Blockers:
		None at the moment.

Jeremy:

	Worked: 
		Implemented Kubernetes manifests for the api, as well as the database, using configmaps for secrets.
		Wrote a starter init.sql

	Goal:
		Jenkinsfile
		Make sure deployment is working.

	Blockers:
		Jenkinsfile stuff
		application bugs make it unclear if kubernetes is properly set up or not. need collaboration to resolve.
		webhook issues
Aaron:

	Worked:
		Implemented cookie auth version in a branch.
	Goal:
		Help with Kubernetes
		Grafana
		Prometheus

	Blockers:
		Kubernetes not quite working
