Summary of events since 17th:

Braylen asked to be relieved of involvement with SRE/Kubernetes topics and passed scrum leadership to Jeremy, so we redistributed the workload last friday. Braylen solo implemented JWT authorization, and in parallel Aaron implemented cookie based authentication. We chose to go with JWT. Jeremy wrote a temp init.sql, wrote the manifests, and set up the build pipeline using a Jenkinsfile. Jeremy and Aaron troubleshooted kubernetes & prometheus discovery issues and ultimately resolved them.
